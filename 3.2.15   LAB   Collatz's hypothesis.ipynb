    "# In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven)\n",
    "# which can be described in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "#     take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it c0;\n",
    "#     if it's even, evaluate a new c0 as c0 ÷ 2;\n",
    "#     otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new c0 as 3 × c0 + 1;\n",
    "#     if c0 ≠ 1, go back to point 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of c0, it will always go to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Of course, it's an extremely complex task to use a computer in order to prove the hypothesis for any natural number\n",
    "# (it may even require artificial intelligence), but you can use Python to check some individual numbers.\n",
    "# Maybe you'll even find the one which would disprove the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write a program which reads one natural number and executes the above steps as long as c0 remains different from 1.\n",
    "# We also want you to count the steps needed to achieve the goal.\n",
    "# Your code should output all the intermediate values of c0, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hint: the most important part of the problem is how to transform Collatz's idea into a while loop – this is the key to success."
